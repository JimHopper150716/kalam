    <h1>About.</h1>
    <p style="font-family:monarch">KALAM. was started because I was keen for innovation and tinkering. But as is the mentality of schools <br>and students alike, the tunnel vision on studies and exams do not let the creativity foster. I was unaware of opportunities like IRIS, ISEF, INSEF, Inspire or multiple other innovation forums, competions, grants <br>and awards that let children help change the world, and let's you connect with a global audience of likeminded peers<br> and mentors. After my studies, I researched heavily and found that most of the reciepents of such honors<br> and oportunities had familial connections with research mentors and professors and an average school fees<br> of â‚¹15000-25000 per month. This disparity didn't settle with my conscience and KALAM. Initiative was born.<br><br>
    We aim to bring a launchpad to all the students and schools, irrespective of their economic background, and provide them guidance on opportunities and foster their ideas to take shape into actual inventions, provide research & mentorship and help them achieve at an international stage. This process was started at my own school, where I informed my peers and juniors about opportunities, and helped them get started in innovating ideas and research. We aim to launch a startup acclerator for high school and undergraduate students, and help them write their own future.</p>
