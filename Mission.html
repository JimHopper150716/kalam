    <h1>Mission.</h1>
    <p style="font-family:monarch">Our mission to change the world starts with simple steps. An umbrella of innovations, fueled by the power of youth and mentorship of experts. We intend to incubate our current startups into actual consumer products and address prevalent problems. Alongside, we are partnering with newsletters and forums to extend the reach of opportunity notifications in all the educational institutions, Kendriya Vidyalayas and Public Schools. Getting children acquainted with networks first in their school, then their locality and later at a national and international stage. We aim to connect all these "Innovators-for-Change" to help each other in exploring new avenues along with labs and mentorship and create a global peer community of optimism, help and shared calling. As a result of successful incubation, we aim to provide an accelerator program to all these high schoolers and undergraduates achieve their dreams and transform their projects into businesses to boost employment and economy of India.</p>
